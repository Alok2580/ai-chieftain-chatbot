## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Conversational AI:** Utilizes Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model to understand user intent and provide intelligent, human-like responses to a wide range of queries.
* **Voice & Chat Interface:** Guests can interact with the chatbot using either text-based chat or voice commands for a hands-free experience.
* **Real-time Staff Dashboard:** A dedicated dashboard for hotel staff that displays incoming booking and room service requests instantly, powered by WebSockets.
* **Interactive Request Management:** Staff can approve or decline guest requests directly from the dashboard. This action sends a real-time confirmation message back to the guest in their chat window, closing the communication loop.
* **Context-Aware Personalization:** The AI maintains a memory of the current conversation, allowing it to provide smart, personalized suggestions based on previous interactions.
* **Smart Intent Recognition:** The system accurately distinguishes between general queries, booking requests, room service orders, and requests to see the menu, routing each to the appropriate action.
* **QR Code Accessibility:** Designed to be accessed instantly by scanning a QR code, launching the web application without requiring any app installation.
